# Github story

Chrome and Firefox extension to use pull request description template with a single button click. [Github already allows repository to has pull request template](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/), but if you contribute to repository without this feature turned on, Github story is your way.

## Troubleshootings 

1. `Firefox` swears page’s settings blocked the loading of script because of `Content Security Policy`:

```bash
Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at self (“script-src”). Source: (function() {
    var pushState = histor....
```

Deal with it by refreshing the page and content of the script will be loaded succesfully.
`Chrome` also swears the same, but does not block any resources and you can use extension in proper way.
