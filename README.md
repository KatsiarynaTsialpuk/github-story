# Github story

Chrome and Firefox extension to use pull request description template with a single button click. [Gihub already allows repository to has pull request template](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/), but if you contribute to repository without this feature turn turned on, Github story is your way.

## Troubleshootings 

1. Firefox swears page’s settings blocked the loading of script because of `Content Security Policy`:

```javascript
Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at self (“script-src”). Source: (function() {
    var pushState = histor....
```

Deal with it by refreshing the page and content of the script will be loaded succesfully.
Github also swears the same, but does not block any resources and you are able to use it in proper way.
